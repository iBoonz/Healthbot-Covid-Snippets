# Scenarios
 
## Self Assessment

The Self Assessment scenario is an scenario originated from a implementation with an European Healthcare organization. 


## QnA integrated in the scenario

Next to adding the QnA in the language model of the Healthbot you can also integrate the Qna in the scenario of the Healthbot. This allows you to extend the Qna scenarios with functionality such as: 

- Provide a customized answer if nothing is found in the QnA KB
- Add Show More... functionality when the text is too long
- Ask if the answered matched the expectation of the question, based on the scoring of the QnA
- Integrate with your backend systems if needed

You can configure your healthBot, to always go to the QnA Scenario with a simple regex
